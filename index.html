        <h2>Self-hosting NextCloud on Raspberry Pi</h2>
        <p>
          In the process of depending less on external cloud services, I wanted to self-host my personal 'cloud' to
          store my data. The best option to achieve that was to create a <a href="https://nextcloud.com">NextCloud</a>
          instance on a Raspberry
          Pi. Having followed a few online tutorials, I wanted to describe some problems I've encountered during the
          setup, and the
          solutions I was able to come up with in order to solve them.
        </p>

        <h2>Hello World: This is Seb's Website</h2>
        <p>
          I decided that it was finally time that I get my own domain. I'll be
          using it mainly for email, and I also plan on starting a blog on here.
          Topics may include software development and some of my hobbies. Looking
          forward to seeing how it evolves!
